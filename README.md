# Final Project - Simulation of Neutron Propagation 

Simulating and visualising random walk propagation of neutrons through one or two materials. Simulation can be done either considering thermal only, non thermal or both types of propagation.

## How to run this code

Please install all the different requirements needed. Can be found in requirements.txt.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Customize simulation_config.yaml, be careful on what you set as true or false, please read the comments written beside some of the variables to understand which to turn on and off. 

Be sure that **Propagation_Data** exists in the code folder, else change the directory in the configuration file.


Running main.py, using local environment.

```
python3 main.py
```

Once file created in the data folder, open the html file in your local browser or double click it. And be amazed by the results!
